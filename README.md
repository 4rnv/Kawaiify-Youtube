Is your browser experience boring? Are you having  
trouble finding engaging click-baity videos?

**Fear no more.**

This extension adds anime characters to every thumbnail.

## Installation

### Firefox

This extension is available on the [Firefox Addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtubekawaiify/) store. You can download it directly from there. This also works for Firefox forks like Tor, Librewolf, Waterfox and Floorp.

### Chrome

This extension is not available on the Chrome store. If you are using Google Chrome or a Chromium based browser you can still install it by cloning this repo or downloading the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/4rnv/Kawaiify-Youtube/releases) section. Then:

- Open your browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.

- Turn on the "Developer mode" toggle in the top right/left corner.

- Click on the "Load unpacked" button. Select the folder where you have extracted this zip file.

- Use.

## Notes

 - This extension is a fork of MagicJinn's [MrBeastify](https://github.com/MagicJinn/MrBeastify-Youtube/) addon.
 - I don't own any of the characters, all belong to their respective creators.
